# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Capstone-Project
For a Credit Card Fraud Analysis Capstone Project, I will be working with a dataset that contains credit card transactions and information about whether each transaction is fraudulent or not. My goal will be to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions and distinguish them from legitimate ones.

Here are some general steps i have followed in project:

Data Understanding: Started by exploring and understanding the dataset. Check for missing values, data types, and distributions of various features. Gain insights into the data and how the target variable (fraudulent or not) is distributed.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues. Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Consider scaling numeric features if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. Visualize the data to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and potentially identify any interesting insights.

Feature Engineering: Created new features or transform existing features that could potentially improve the model's performance. Feature engineering is crucial in detecting fraudulent patterns that might not be apparent in the raw data.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task. Commonly used algorithms for fraud detection include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Model Training and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This is done using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

Model Interpretation: I interpreted the model's predictions and understand which features are contributing the most to the fraud detection.

Model Deployment: Deploied it in a production-like environment to test its performance on new, unseen data.

Documentation and Presentation: Document each step of your analysis, including the data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation results, and any challenges faced during the project. Prepare a presentation summarizing your approach and findings.
